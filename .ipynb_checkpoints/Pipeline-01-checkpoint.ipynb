    "# 1. Kalman Filter Basics \n",
    "\n",
    "Kalman filter is an iterative mathematical process that uses a set of equations and consecutive data inputs to quickly estimate the true value, position, velocity, etc. of the object being measured, when the measured values contain unpredicted or random error, uncertainty, or variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process, we start with an initial estimate of a measurement, with certain amount of error or uncertainty. As we receive more data inputs and we go through this iterative process, the Kalman Filter’s estimated value narrows down close to the actual value of the measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main calculations that need to be done – in an iterative way: \n",
    "1. Calculate the Kalman Gain \n",
    "2. Calculate the current estimate \n",
    "3. Calculate the new error (uncertainty) in the new estimate \n",

    "\n",
    "## 1-1. Calculate the Kalman Gain - KG \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main sources of error – uncertainty – in the system: \n",
    "  - a. Error in estimate. This error refers to previous error; however, for the initial step, we use original error instead. \n",
    "  - b. Error in data input, i.e. observation in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kalman gain - KG - applies a relative importance factor – gain – onto these two errors. In other words, it quantifies how much we can trust these two errors, in the estimate and in the data. The result of Kalman Gain is then fed into the estimation of the current estimate. KG is calculated using the following formula:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "KG = \\frac{E_{EST}}{E_{EST} + E_{MEA}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_{EST}$ is error in the estimate and $E_{MEA}$ refers to error in the measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1-2. Calculate the Current Estimate \n",
    "\n",
    "The current estimate is calculated by three inputs: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Previous estimate (or original error at initial step) \n",
    "- Error in data input \n",
    "- Kalman gain, KG, which is calculated in the first step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of updating current estimate is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "EST_t = EST_{t-1} + KG \\cdot (MEA - EST_{t-1})\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a closer look at the two extreme values of KG.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- When $E_{EST}$ is high, $KG$ approaches 1 and therefore $KG$ puts more importance to the measurement, $MEA$, to update the current estimation, $EST_{t-1}$. \n",
    "- When $E_{EST}$ is much smaller than $E_{MEA}$, $KG$ approaches 0 and therefore $KG$ puts more importance to the previous estimate, $EST_{t-1}$, to update the current estimation, $EST_{t-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the value of $KG$ should become smaller and smaller and ideally get close to zero, i.e. the estimate become closer to the true value. Therefore, we can rely more and more on estimates rather than measurements, which could be very erratic due to big uncertainty in them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1-3. Calculate the New Error (Uncertainty) in the New Estimate \n",
    "\n",
    "The current estimated error (uncertainty) is calculated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "E_{EST_{t}} = \\frac{(E_{MEA}) \\cdot (E_{EST_{t-1}})} {(E_{MEA}) + (E_{EST_{t-1}})}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is also often written as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "E_{EST_{t}} = [1 - KG] (E_{EST_{t-1}})\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this formula we can see that: \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the error in the measurement is very small, $KG \\rightarrow 1$, the new error, $E_{EST_{t}}$, goes to zero very quickly.  \n",
    "- If the error in the measurement is very large, $KG \\rightarrow 0$, the new error, $E_{EST_{t}}$, goes to zero very slowly. \n",

    "In the first chapter we have seen how Kalman Filter works in a single variable or single state problem. In this section we will see how it works in matrix format.

    ">**Standard Dviation vs Variance**:  \n",
    "\n",
    ">Standard deviation of a set of scattered data points, $\\sigma_{x}$, is simply squared root of variance, $\\sigma_{x}^2$. But since the elements of a covariance matrix are vaiances, it may be helpful to quickly compare the meaning of Standard Dviation vs Variance.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">- **Meaning:**  \n",
    "  Standard deviation is a measure of dispersion of observations within a data set. For example, Standard deviation means that about $2/3$ of the values reside within $\\bar {x} \\pm \\sigma_{x}$;  \n",
    "  Variance is a numerical value that describes the variability of observations from its arithmetic mean.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">- **Indication:**  \n",
    "  Standard deviation indicates how much observations of a data set differs from its mean;  \n",
    "  Variance indicates how far individuals in a group are spread out.\t \n",
    "  \n",
    ">- **Unit:**  \n",
    "  Standard deviation has same units as the values in the set of data;  \n",
    "  Variance has Squared units, therefore, it is no longer in the same unit of measurement as the original data.  \n",
    "\n",
    ">Subjectively, Standard deviation is more preferable to use rathen than variance. However, expressing the equations in matrix form will lead to appearance of variance at the elements of covariance matrix. The diagonal elmenets are the same as squared of standard deviation, i.e. $\\sigma_{x}^2$, $\\sigma_{y}^2$, etc. However, the off-diagonal elements will reveal additional information about the relative spread of the data across two axes.

Therefore, for consistancy purposes, we do not change the format of state matrix $X$ and instead, matrix $H$ removes/nullify the velocity elements.  \n",

    "After updating the state prediction and state measurement - as discussed above - we let KG decide (calculate) what fraction of the theoretical/predicted and measured values should be contributed into updating the new state. The Kalman gain is a means to assign a weight factor into 'estimation' and 'measured value' (as discussed above). An example of the discrepancy between the measurement and prediction is the error due the delay in measurement process, e.g. by the time we measure a distance of a satellite, it may have moved from the original position. It should be noted that observation provides valuable source of information and we should not simply miss it because of over-confidence in our prediction step. This is another reason why we need to add a regularizer, which in this case it is the **process noise covariance matrix**, $Q$, as introduced above.  \n",

    "\n",
    "In practice, we may have to deal with updating the states based on the measuremrnts received from multiple sensors, reporting the same type of information (e.g. position and velocity), but in different formats. Therefore, Extended Kalman Filter process is introduced to handle more complex motion and measurement models. For example, to track an object, we can use two sensors, a Rarad and a Lidar (or a laser sensor). The measurement-update step depends on the sensor type; Radar measurement involves a nonlinear measurement function, as opposed to the linear function discused above (section [2-3](#section_2-3)). In this framework, each sensor has its own prediction update scheme and the process continues asynchronously, the same as before, even if we receive several measurements at the same time.  \n",

    "\n",
    "## Radar Measurement  \n",
    "\n",
    "The power of Kalman filter is to be able to fuse sensor readings from different sources. Each sensor may work differently, providing different outputs. For example, Lidar sensor can provide information about position - and not velocity - of an object at hight time increment resolution. On the other hand, Radar sensor can directly measure and provide the object's radial velocity (using doppler effect) and at lower time increment resolution as compared to that of Lidar. Using extended Kalman filter process, we can fuse the different measurements received from these two sensors at different time increments to estimate the position and velocity of the tracked object. \n",
