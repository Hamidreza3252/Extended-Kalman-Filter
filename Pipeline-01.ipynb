    "# 1. Kalman Filter Basics \n",
    "\n",
    "Kalman filter is an iterative mathematical process that uses a set of equations and consecutive data inputs to quickly estimate the true value, position, velocity, etc. of the object being measured, when the measured values contain unpredicted or random error, uncertainty, or variation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this process, we start with an initial estimate of a measurement, with certain amount of error or uncertainty. As we receive more data inputs and we go through this iterative process, the Kalman Filter’s estimated value narrows down close to the actual value of the measurement. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main calculations that need to be done – in an iterative way: \n",
    "1. Calculate the Kalman Gain \n",
    "2. Calculate the current estimate \n",
    "3. Calculate the new error (uncertainty) in the new estimate \n",

    "## 1-1. Calculate the Kalman Gain - KG \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main sources of error – uncertainty – in the system: \n",
    "  - a. Error in estimate. This error refers to previous error; however, for the initial step, we use original error instead. \n",
    "  - b. Error in data input, i.e. observation in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kalman gain - KG - applies a relative importance factor – gain – onto these two errors. In other words, it quantifies how much we can trust these two errors, in the estimate and in the data. The result of Kalman Gain is then fed into the estimation of the current estimate. KG is calculated using the following formula:   \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "KG = \\frac{E_{EST}}{E_{EST} + E_{MEA}}\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1-2. Calculate the Current Estimate \n",
    "\n",
    "The current estimate is calculated by three inputs: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Previous estimate (or original error at initial step) \n",
    "- Error in data input \n",
    "- Kalman gain, KG, which is calculated in the first step. \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of updating current estimate is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "EST_t = EST_{t-1} + KG \\cdot (MEA - EST_{t-1})\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take a closer look at the two extreme values of KG.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- When $E_{EST}$ is high, $KG$ approaches 1 and therefore $KG$ puts more importance to the measurement, $MEA$, to update the current estimation, $EST_{t-1}$. \n",
    "- When $E_{EST}$ is much smaller than $E_{MEA}$, $KG$ approaches 0 and therefore $KG$ puts more importance to the previous estimate, $EST_{t-1}$, to update the current estimation, $EST_{t-1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the value of $KG$ should become smaller and smaller and ideally get close to zero, i.e. the estimate become closer to the true value. Therefore, we can rely more and more on estimates rather than measurements, which could be very erratic due to big uncertainty in them. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1-3. Calculate the New Error (Uncertainty) in the New Estimate \n",
    "\n",
    "The current estimated error (uncertainty) is calculated as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "E_{EST_{t}} = \\frac{(E_{MEA}) \\cdot (E_{EST_{t-1}})} {(E_{MEA}) + (E_{EST_{t-1}})}\n",

    "E_{EST_{t}} = [1 - KG] (E_{EST_{t-1}})\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this formula we can see that: \n",
    "\n",
    "- If the error in the measurement is very small, $KG \\rightarrow 1$, the new error, $E_{EST_{t}}$, goes to zero very quickly.  \n",
    "- If the error in the measurement is very large, $KG \\rightarrow 0$, the new error, $E_{EST_{t}}$, goes to zero very slowly. \n",

Therefore, we have also add the **process noise covariance matrix** to the calculations. This noise can include any stimulus, affecting dynamic of the system and we have not accounted for in our model of the system. Kalman filter process would work only if we account for a reasonable expectation of the error in the process.

But if we take the valus of variance, instead of SD, we expect to have almost $100\\%$ of the data within that range (i.e. value wise, otherwise $3 SD$ would also cover almost $99\\%$). For Kalman filter process we use variance to ensure that we open up the gate (in both estimation anf measurement) large enough that we can expect all possible values fall within this range.  \n",

If we consolidate these values and put them in matrix format, we have to define the covariance matrix. Therefore, the diagonal elements represent variations in the individual measurements, e.g. $x$ or $y$, and the off-diagonal elements represent the co-variance, i.e. the variance related to other measurements, e.g. $x$ and $y$.

For example, if the error in the observation is large, we would put more valie into the estimation, i.e. $K \\rightarrow 0$. In that case, we tend to ignore the observation and observation error as $P \\rightarrow 0$. Observation provides valuable source of information and we should not simply miss it because of over-confidence in our estimation.

Therefore, Extended Kalman Filter process is introduced to handle more complex motion and measurement models. For example, to track an object, we can use two sensors, a Rarad and a Lidar (or a laser sensor). The measurement-update step depends on the sensor type; Radar measurement involves a non-linear measurement function, as opposed to the linear function discused above (section [2-3](#section_2-3)). Therefore, we may have to use extended Kalman filter equations. In this framework, each sensor has its own prediction update scheme and the process continues asynchronously, the same as before, even if we receive several measurements at the same time. \n"
