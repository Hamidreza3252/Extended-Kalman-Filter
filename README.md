# Kalman Filter, An Overview 

- I have prepared this repository to summarize Kalman filter processes based on following resources: 

  - [Lectures in the Kalman Filter](http://www.ilectureonline.com/lectures/subject/SPECIAL%20TOPICS/26/190)
  - Udacity Self-Driving car courses 
  - Some other online reading materials 
  
- Due to a deficiency in GitHub in parsing LaTex equations, I have put the content in the [Pipeline Jupyter file](Pipeline-01.ipynb) for better readability. 

I am also working on a sample project (in progress), impletemting this process.
